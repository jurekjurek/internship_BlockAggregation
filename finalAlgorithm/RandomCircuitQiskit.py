'''
to check if two gates commute, we do the following. 

We get the random circuit by quiskit. This is a circuit that does a random manipulation of two random qubits with one another. 
Now, for each gate, we look at the corresponding part in the circuit and calculate the matrix of this *part* of the circuit. 
Then, to check if these two commute, we take the two matrices A and B - corresponding to the two Gates and check if 

A * B = B * A

if so, they commute. 

Then, we have to make the circuit compatible with the format of *numbers* that our block aggregation (and the optimization) works with. 
So, we have to reduce the propery of commuting gates with numbers (the numbers of the gates) and the numbers of the qubits that these gates hold.
