'''
explanation in blockaggregation:

    If a qubit in one particular gate has been encountered already before, it is part of another pointer set. 
    *BUT* if the gate of this qubit commutes with the other gate that acts on the same qubit in the next step, we can *move* the qubit from the first 
    aggregated sublist to the recent one. 

    ///////////////////////////////
    Here is an EXAMPLE:

    Gate 1: Qubits 9,1 
    Gate 2: Qubits 1,2
    Gate 3: Qubits 3,6
    Gate 4: Qubits 5,7
    Gate 5: Qubits 9,6

    the first step in the algorithm will create S = [[9,1,2], [0], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]] if we have 10 qubits in total 

    where the first two gates have been taken care of. The next steps are: 

    S = [[9,1,2], [3,6], [5,7], [0], [4], [8]]

    So far, so good. We have not encountered any difficulties with commutation yet. Now, however, we are confronted with the gate 
    Gate 5: Qubits 9,6

    What the algorithm would do so far, taking into account only the fact if there are equal qubits in two gates when evaluating their commutation: 
    S = [[9,1,2,3,6], [5,7], [0], [4], [8]]

    But, what we could do now, when it happens that gate 3 and gate 5 commute: 
    S = [[9,1,2,6], [5,7], [0], [3], [4], [8]]

    as an intermediate step, which *could* lead to a better gate coverage. 
    The best gate coverage could then correspond to this intermediate step. If not, we would of course have to execute gate 5 now as well which would lead us 
    again to: 
    S = [[9,1,2,6,3], [5,7], [0], [4], [8]]

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    The new commutation aspect only gives us these intermediate steps that *could* provide better gate coverages. And this is essentially what we want. 

    What we essentially have to do in the algorithm: 
    
    Upon merging to sets, merging qubits together: 
    - check if the gates containing the same qubits commute. If they commute: 
        - merge the qubit possibly to next sublists on the left. 
        - essentially do the algorithm, but start now at the left of the sublist that was skipped due to commutation
        - if in there, there is a gate involved that this gate commutes with, we dont have to skip this sublist, since there are only 2 qubits in each gate. 
        - Create the new aggregated qubit sets, merge the corresponding qubit
        - in the next step, execute the gate of interest (corresponding to the last step in the example above)
        - Carry on
    - if they don't commute -> carry on
