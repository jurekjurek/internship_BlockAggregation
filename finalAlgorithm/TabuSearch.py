    This function performs the Tabu search! 

    What is the tabu search? 

    The idea is that a tabu list is stored. This tabu list contains previously visited solutions. 
    A local search in the neighbourhood of a current solution and jumps to the best solution, given it is not on the tabu list. Note that the best solution can also be locally worsening. 

    The tabu list is of finite size and upon adding a new element to it, the oldest element in the list gets deleted. 

    The algorithm remembers the best solution so far and returns it after a given number of iterations. 

    How do we go about this. We perform the whole tabu search algorithm in three steps: 
        
        1.  Optimize the arrangement of the processing blocks. Swap whole procesing blocks (as opposed to only swapping processing zones)

        2.  Optimize the arrangement of the idle qubits within each layer. 
            Randomly pick a processing layer d and an an idle qubit from the corresponding idle pool 
            Compute cost metric for swapping it with all other idle qubits. 

        3.  Optimize the arrangement of the qubits within the processing blocks. 
            Randomly pick a layer, a processing block and a qubit within this processing block, either active or idle. 
            Compute the cost metric of swapping this qubit with all other qubits in the *same* processing zone.
