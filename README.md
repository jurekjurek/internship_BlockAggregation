In this project, the experimental execution of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is optimised with respect to its experimental realisation. 
In the process of carrying out a quantum algorithm on a quantum circuit, or even a quantum circuit in general, qubits (ions with two accesable energy levels) have to be moved around to be entangled with each other. 
This project optimises this scheme with the objective of minimising the overall movement of the qubits.
